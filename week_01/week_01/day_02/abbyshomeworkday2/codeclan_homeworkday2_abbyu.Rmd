This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
starbucks_calories <- read_csv("starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.csv")
```

```{r}
starbucks_calories
dim(starbucks_calories)
class(starbucks_calories)
colnames(starbucks_calories)
```
```{r}
drinks_caloriesq2 <- (select(starbucks_calories, "Beverage_category", "Beverage", "Beverage_prep", "Calories"))
  filter(drinks_caloriesq2,!is.na(drinks_caloriesq2))
```
```{r}
drinks_caloriesq2 <- mutate(drinks_caloriesq2, calorie_diff = 135 - Calories)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
grouped_drinks <- group_by(drinks_caloriesq2, Beverage_category)
summarise(grouped_drinks, mean(Calories))
```
```{r}
head(grouped_drinks, 3)
tail(grouped_drinks, 3)
```

```{r}
avg_beverage_prep <-  group_by(drinks_caloriesq2, Beverage_prep)
summarise(avg_beverage_prep, mean(Calories))
```

```{r}
arrange(drinks_caloriesq2, Calories) %>%
