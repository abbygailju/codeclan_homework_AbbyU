```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(GGally)
library(broom)
library(ggfortify)
```

```{r}
project <- read_csv("../day_1/6_homework/data/project_management.csv")

project
```

```{r}
project %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = estimated_length,  y = actual_length)+
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
model <- lm(formula = actual_length ~ estimated_length, data = project)

model
```

#### Interpret the regression coefficient of estimated_length (i.e. slope, gradient) you obtain from the model. How do you interpret the r2 value reported by the model?

```{r}
glance(model)
```
The r squared is 0.6474772 which shows the regression fits the model to some extent
 
#### Is the relationship statistically significant?
